abstract = {Piezoelectric wafer active sensors (PWAS) are inexpensive, non-intrusive un-obtrusive devices that can be surface-mounted on existing structures, or inserted in a new composite structure. The PWAS can be used in both active and passive modes. In active mode, the PWAS generate Lamb waves that can exist as either traveling waves or standing waves. As traveling waves, PWAS-generated Lamb waves can be used with the pitch-catch, pulse-echo, or phased-array methods that arrow far-field and some medium-field damage detection. As standing waves, PWAS-generated Lamb waves can used in conjunction with the electro-mechanical (E/M) impedance technique that allows near field and some medium-field damage detection. This paper presents new results obtained in the use of PWAS for the structural health monitoring of aerospace vehicles. One set of results to be presented will refer to experiments performed on detection the crack propagation in a fracture-mechanics panel with a stress-concentration precrack in the center. The crack was propagated using cyclic fatigue loading in a large testing machine. The crack was imaged with the PWAS EUSR method, which is the guided Lamb wave equivalent of the P-wave C-scan, only that it is produced from a single location and does not need a raster x-y coverage like the conventional P-wave C-scan. PWAS EUSR measurements were taken while the testing machine was running, thus simulating in-service monitoring conditions. Another set of results refers to the PWAS monitoring of disbonds in an spacecraft panel. The E/M impedance technique is shown to distinguish clearly between a bonded and disbonded part. The E/M impedance of bonded part measured at different locations is shown to be consistently the same, with the actual curves overlapping, thus confirming that the impedance changes noticed at the disbonded location are solely due to disbonding.},

abstract = {A spectral element method that combines the generality of the finite element method with the accuracy of spectral techniques is proposed for the numerical solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. In the spectral element discretization, the computational domain is broken into a series of elements, and the velocity in each element is represented as a high-order Lagrangian interpolant through Chebyshev collocation points. The hyperbolic piece of the governing equations is then treated with an explicit collocation scheme, while the pressure and viscous contributions are treated implicitly with a projection operator derived from a variational principle. The implementation of the technique is demonstrated on a one-dimensional inflow-outflow advection-diffusion equation, and the method is then applied to laminar two-dimensional (separated) flow in a channel expansion. Comparisons are made with experiment and previous numerical work. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

abstract = {A spectral finite element model (SFEM) for analysis of axial-flexural-shear coupled wave propagation in thick laminated composite beams is presented. Range of validity of the first order shear deformation in the context of higher order Lamb wave modes is discussed. Concept of spectral element shape function, dynamic strain-displacement matrix and dynamically consistent force vector are derived. An exact dynamic stiffness matrix is derived, which is used in finite element (FE) analysis. Computation is performed in the Fourier domain at FFT sampling points over broad frequency band. Post-processing of the response is performed in both the frequency domain as well as in the time domain, which is suitable for structural diagnostics and broad-band wave propagation problems. To extend the range of engineering applications of SFEM, linear damping models are formulated. Effect of viscous damping on group speeds and wave amplitudes are studied for graphite-epoxy composite beams. Response under impact type loading is compared with time domain FE results. Numerical examples are presented, where the effect of axial-flexural-shear coupling is characterized. Efficient application of the model is shown considering laminated beam with ply-drops. Also a global/local model for estimation of Mode-II crack tip field in a delaminated thick composite beam is presented. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this work a spectral element method in conjunction with a new iterative solution technique is presented. The very high spatial accuracy of the algorithm allows for increased computational efficiency when compared to standard finite element method. In addition, the use of an iterative solver, based on a local element-by-element formulation and a matrix-vector product which is factored and converted to a faster matrix-matrix product, allows for a significant reduction both in storage requirements and in the computational complexity. The resulting algorithm can easily be implemented on high-performance vector and/or parallel processors. The numerical scheme has been tested on a Cray T3E supercomputer. Our experimental results show that efficiency is very high and that good load balancing can be obtained at run time, because relevant blocks of computations are performed at the element level and are totally independent.},

abstract = {Engineering structures undergo gradual destruction in the course of time as a result of static and dynamic loading, temperature, humidity, wind or corrosive factors. Since damage in structural ele- ments may lead to improper operation of any engineering object, various damage detection techniques have been investigated to improve reliability and safety of structures. The guided wave-based damage detection methods have been dynamically developed over last years, because guided waves are very suitable for inspecting large structures due to their ability of propagation over long distances with a little amplitude loss. The purpose of this study is to conduct detailed experimental and numerical investigations on ultrasonic guided wave propagation in steel structures. The particular aims are: (a) modelling of wave propagation phenomenon in structural elements including dispersion effects; (b) developing of nu- merical models for wave propagation; (c) systematic experimental verification of the developed nu- merical models; (d) application of the guided wave-based technique to damage detection. The first part of the work describes wave propagation in structural elements. The governing equations for several models of rods, beams and plates providing approximated description of wave motion are derived. Verification of the models is conducted by comparing dispersion relations with exact Lamb modes. The study indicates necessity of using higher order theories (the Mindlin-Herrmann rod theory, the Timoshenko beam, the Kane-Mindlin theory of extensional plates and the Mindlin theory of bending plates) when analysing waves of ultrasonic frequencies because the higher order theories can adequately account for dispersive behaviour of the lowest symmetric and antisymmetric modes. The next part of the work describes the spectral element method. The spatial discretization is based on high-degree Legendre interpolants spread over Gauss-Legendre-Lobatto (GLL) nodes and the spatial integration is performed using the GLL quadrature. Such numerical strategy provides the exponential accuracy and a reduction of the computational cost because a mass matrix is exactly diagonal by construction as a result of the GLL integration rule. Special spectral elements based on the considered higher order theories are formulated, in particular the frame spectral element based on the Mindlin-Herrmann rod and Timoshenko beam theories, as well as the extensional plate element based on the Kane-Mindlin theory and the bending plate element based on the Mindlin theory. A substantial part of the study contains experimental and numerical analyses of wave propaga- tion in rods, beams, frames and plates. In the experimental investigations, structural elements are excited by means of the piezoelectric actuator and propagating velocity signals are detected and rec- orded by the laser vibrometer. Experimental dispersion curves are obtained for the considered fre- quency range 50–300 kHz to determine adjustable parameters for the approximate theories applied in the numerical models. The effectiveness of the proposed spectral element models has been experi- mentally confirmed. The model based on the Mindlin-Herrmann rod and Timoshenko beam theories guarantees reasonable approximation for the first longitudinal and flexural modes behaviour, which has been proved by the comparison with the experimentally measured signals. Similarly, the Kane- Mindlin theory for extensional plate waves and the Mindlin theory for flexural plate waves provide a very accurate description of dispersive behaviour of the first mode of longitudinal and flexural waves. The results of the analyses show that the numerical model of an arbitrary frame or plate structure intended as a part of the SHM system should be described in the SEM formulation based on the high- er order theories to obtain proper times of reflections from potential damage. Finally, an application of ultrasonic guided waves to damage detection is presented. Detection of damage in various forms of discontinuity of cross-section and material is considered by analysing guided wave response signals in the form of A-scans, B-scans and C-scans. As a result, the study discusses in detail the possibility of detection of damage in rods, beams, frames and plates and it compares the usefulness of longitudinal and flexural waves in nondestructive damage detection.},

Basically, the model inputs electrical voltage to actuators and outputs electrical signals of sensors. To visualize the transient dynamic wave motions in the structure generated by the transducer, the code is integrated with commercial pre/postprocessing software to provide graphical outputs of the dynamic deformations of the structure.

abstract = {In the current paper we present a fast, reliable technique for simulating wave propagation in complex structures made of heterogeneous materials. The proposed approach, the spectral cell method, is a combination of the finite cell method and the spectral element method that significantly lowers preprocessing and computational expenditure. The spectral cell method takes advantage of explicit time-integration schemes coupled with a diagonal mass matrix to reduce the time spent on solving the equation system. By employing a fictitious domain approach, this method also helps to eliminate some of the difficulties associated with mesh generation. Besides introducing a proper, specific mass lumping technique, we also study the performance of the low-order and high-order versions of this approach based on several numerical examples. Our results show that the high-order version of the spectral cell method together requires less memory storage and less CPU time than other possible versions, when combined simultaneously with explicit time-integration algorithms. Moreover, as the implementation of the proposed method in available finite element programs is straightforward, these properties turn the method into a viable tool for practical applications such as structural health monitoring [1--3], quantitative ultrasound applications [4], or the active control of vibrations and noise [5, 6].},

abstract = {This paper deals with a semi-analytical finite element (SAFE) method for modeling wave propagation in waveguides of arbitrary cross-section. The method simply requires the finite element discretization of the cross-section of the waveguide, and assumes harmonic motion along the wave propagation direction. The general SAFE technique is extended to account for viscoelastic material damping by allowing for complex stiffness matrices for the material. The dispersive solutions are obtained in terms of phase velocity, group velocity (for undamped media), energy velocity (for damped media), attenuation, and cross-sectional mode shapes. Knowledge of these properties is important in any structural health monitoring attempt that uses ultrasonic guided waves. The proposed SAFE formulation is applied to several examples, including anisotropic viscoelastic layered plates, composite-to-composite adhesive joints and railroad tracks. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Guided Ultrasonic Waves (GUW) are regarded as an effective technique for impact damage assessment of CFRP structures. Especially in the aerospace field, the introduction of such a system requires the compliance with the applicable standards and regulations. This is certainly mandatory due to safety considerations. Besides that, performance and reliability of SHM is as well of major importance to make an SHM system economically useful. Accuracy and precision of damage assessment is of high interest, which for conventional NDT methods is reflected in the probability of damage detection (PoD) and the false alarm rate. Here, the damage assessment performance (DAP) for a certain class of SHM systems is detailed as a transfer of the known PoD. The reliability analysis is an elementary step in particular in the development of SHM systems, including the inherent complexity of the utilized technique and the applicable boundary conditions. In this paper, first considerations on this reliability analysis are presented, covering especially application dependant aspects.},

abstract = {An efficient and robust finite element-based transient analysis of structures is important in many engineering applications. In this context, a diagonal or lumped mass matrix is an essential prerequisite. In the last decades, several methods to construct such a mass matrix have been proposed and therefore a comprehensive and unbiased evaluation of these approaches is needed. In the present article, we consequently investigate established mass lumping schemes, such as the row-sum method and the diagonal scaling method, as well as the recently proposed manifold-based method. Furthermore, the latter approach is rigorously extended to higher order serendipity finite elements in two and three dimensions. Note that the manifold-based method and the diagonal scaling method are very general approaches, in the sense that they are applicable to arbitrary nodal-based shape functions with arbitrary polynomial orders, while guaranteeing the positive-definiteness of the lumped mass matrix. With respect to the row-sum method the positivity is not ensured and negative or zero diagonal components might be computed. Consequently, a detailed analysis of the influence and performance of these mass lumping schemes on the numerical results is conducted. To this end, several dynamic benchmark models (including modal, harmonic, and transient analyses) are selected, showing that only suboptimal rates of convergence are attained if serendipity finite elements based on a diagonal mass matrix are employed.},

abstract = {Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) applications call for both efficient and powerful numerical tools to predict the behavior of ultrasonic guided waves. When considering waves in thin-walled structures, so called Lamb waves, conventional linear or quadratic pure displacement finite elements soon reach their limits. The spatial as well as temporal discretisation, required to obtain good quality results has to be very fine. This results in enormous computational costs (computational time and memory storage requirements) when ultrasonic wave propagation problems are solved in the time domain. To resolve this issue several higher order finite element methods with polynomial degrees p{\textgreater}. 2 are proposed. The objective of the current article is to develop such higher order schemes and to verify their capabilities with respect to accuracy and numerical performance. To the best of the authors' knowledge such comparison has not been reported in literature, yet. Specifically, spectral elements based on Lagarange polynomials (SEM), p-elements using the normalized integrals of the Legendre polynomials (p-FEM) and isogeometric elements utilizing non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS, N-FEM) are discussed in this paper. By solving a two-dimensional benchmark problem, their advantages and drawbacks with respect to Lamb wave propagation are highlighted. The results of the convergence studies are then used to derive guidelines for estimating the optimal element size for a given finite element type and polynomial degree template. These findings serve the purpose to determine the optimal mesh configuration a priori and thus, save a considerable amount of computational effort. The proposed guideline is then tested on a three-dimensional structure with a conical hole showing an excellent agreement with the predicted behaviour. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The comparison of finite elements (FE) and experimental data fields have become ever more prevalent in numerical simulations. Since FE and experimental data fields rarely match, the interpolation of one field into the other is a fundamental step of the procedure. When one of the fields comes from FE, using the existing FE mesh and shape functions is a natural choice to determine mesh degrees of freedom at data point coordinates. This makes no assumptions beyond those already made in the FE model. In this sense, interpolation using element shape functions is exact. However, crude implementations of this technique generally display a quadratic computation complexity with respect to mesh size and number of data points, which is impractical when large data fields must be compared repeatedly. This document aims at assembling existing numerical procedures to improve the interpolation efficiency. With a combination of cross-products, bounding-boxes and indexing methods, the resulting algorithm shows linear computation cost, providing significant improvement in efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2009 Lavoisier, Paris.},

abstract = {In this paper, a 2D wavelet-based spectral finite element (WSFE) is developed for a anisotropic laminated composite plate to study wave propagation. Spectral element model captures the exact inertial distribution as the governing partial differential equations (PDEs) are solved exactly in the transformed frequency-wave-number domain. Thus, the method results in large computational savings compared to conventional finite element (FE) modeling, particularly for wave propagation analysis. In this approach, first, Daubechies scaling function approximation is used in both time and one spatial dimensions to reduce the coupled PDEs to a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Similar to the conventional fast Fourier transform (FFT) based spectral finite element (FSFE), the frequency-dependent wave characteristics can also be extracted directly from the present formulation. However, most importantly, the use of localized basis functions in the present 2D WSFE method circumvents several limitations of the corresponding 2D FSFE technique. Here, the formulated element is used to study wave propagation in laminated composite plates with different ply orientations, both in time and frequency domains.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, The Author(s) 2016. Ultrasonic-guided wave propagation in stiffened composite panels is modeled using the wavelet spectral finite element method. The model is capable of analyzing transient response resulting from loads with short time duration, such as impacts. The model can also be used to predict the response for known excitations commonly used in ultrasonic wave–based structural health monitoring/nondestructive inspection systems. Wavelet spectral finite element is an efficient and accurate technique for wave propagation modeling in structures. Governing equations of laminated plate elements used in the model are based on the first-order shear deformation theory, which yields accurate solutions up to wavelengths close to plate thickness. Daubechies compactly supported scaling functions are used to approximate the partial differential equations in time and one spatial dimension. Resulting ordinary differential equations are rearranged and solved for wavenumbers by assuming a harmonic solution in the transformed frequency-wavenumber domain. The global dynamic stiffness matrix of the spectral plate element is formed relating transformed nodal forces and displacements. Stiffened panel is then assembled following a procedure similar to conventional finite element method, and the resulting matrix equation is solved in the frequency-wavenumber domain. Wavelet spectral finite element results are validated with conventional finite element simulations performed in Abaqus {\textregistered} . In addition to transient response prediction, the usefulness of wavelet spectral finite element–based skin–stiffener model is shown in structural health monitoring for detecting skin–stiffener debond and transverse surface crack.},

abstract = {This article presents the development of a three-dimensional spectral element-based Piezo-Enabled Spectral Element Analysis code to simulate piezo-induced ultrasonic wave propagation in composite structures. Piezo-Enabled Spectral Element Analysis solves the coupled electromechanical governing equations for a given arbitrary voltage input to a piezoelectric actuator and outputs the voltage response of the piezoelectric sensors. In case of modeling laminated composites, one element per ply is computationally expensive, and smeared material properties may give inaccurate results; hence, a layered solid spectral element is introduced. Layered solid spectral element can model several plies per element and uses combined nodal quadrature and Simpson's 1/3 integration rule for numerical integration of mechanical stiffness matrix. It is worth noting that Piezo-Enabled Spectral Element Analysis can interface with commercial finite element mesh generators such as Abaqus/CAE to model structures with complex configuration. Delaminations and debonds are modeled by separating the nodes in the damaged area to create a volume split. Experiments and simulations have been carried out to verify and validate Piezo-Enabled Spectral Element Analysis for composites.

abstract = {Biomechanical modeling methods can be used to predict deformations for medical image registration and particularly, they are very effective for whole-body computed tomography (CT) image registration because differences between the source and target images caused by complex articulated motions and soft tissues deformations are very large. The biomechanics-based image registration method needs to deform the source images using the deformation field predicted by finite element models (FEMs). In practice, the global and local coordinate systems are used in finite element analysis. This involves the transformation of coordinates from the global coordinate system to the local coordinate system when calculating the global coordinates of image voxels for warping images. In this paper, we present an efficient numerical inverse isoparametric mapping algorithm to calculate the local coordinates of arbitrary points within the eight-noded hexahedral finite element. Verification of the algorithm for a nonparallelepiped hexahedral element confirms its accuracy, fast convergence, and efficiency. The algorithm's application in warping of the whole-body CT using the deformation field predicted by means of a biomechanical FEM confirms its reliability in the context of whole-body CT registration.},
